# Implementing Multiplayer in "The Stack"

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of how you can approach implementing multiplayer for your Three.js game, "The Stack".

### Core Concepts: How Multiplayer Games Work

First, it's essential to understand the architectural model. For a persistent world like yours, the **Authoritative Client-Server Model** is the standard and most secure approach.

*   **The Server:** This is the single source of truth. It runs on a machine you control (e.g., a Node.js application). Its job is to manage the entire game state: where every player is, what the tower looks like, and who is carrying a brick. When a player wants to do something (like move or place a block), they send a request to the server. The server validates it, updates the official game state, and then tells all the other players what happened. This prevents cheating because no single player can decide the state of the game.
*   **The Client (Your App):** The client's main jobs are to render the world based on the data it gets from the server and to capture the player's input (keyboard, joystick) and send it to the server. To make the game feel smooth, clients use techniques like interpolation (to smooth out the movement of other players) and prediction (to make the local player's own movement feel instantaneous).

### Networking Protocols: The Language of the Internet

The choice of protocol determines how data is sent between the client and server. The two main types for web games are:

1.  **WebSockets (using TCP):** This is the most common choice for web games. It's a reliable, ordered connection. Think of it like a phone call—everything you say arrives in the order you said it. This is great for critical game events that *must* get through, like placing a block, picking one up, or sending a chat message. `Socket.IO` is a popular library that makes WebSockets easy to use.
2.  **WebRTC DataChannels (can use UDP):** This is a more advanced option that is better for real-time, fast-paced data like player movement. It works more like sending a stream of postcards—some might get lost or arrive out of order, but that's okay because a new one with more up-to-date information is already on its way. This results in lower perceived latency for movement.

### Libraries & Frameworks: Your Toolkit

You don't have to build everything from scratch. Here are some excellent tools, from low-level libraries to full-featured frameworks:

**Low-Level Libraries (More DIY):**

*   **Socket.IO:** The industry standard for WebSocket-based communication in Node.js. It's incredibly robust, well-documented, and has a huge community. Many tutorials and examples use it, making it a great starting point for learning the fundamentals.
*   **geckos.io:** A fantastic library if you want the performance benefits of UDP. It cleverly uses WebRTC DataChannels to establish a client-server connection, which is ideal for synchronizing player positions with minimal lag.

**High-Level Frameworks (Recommended):**

These are purpose-built for making multiplayer games and solve many common problems for you.

*   **Colyseus:** This is a very popular and powerful choice. It's a complete game server framework that handles state synchronization, has a concept of "rooms" (which would be perfect for your game world), and is highly optimized for performance. It's a more structured approach that will save you a lot of time in the long run.
*   **Nengi.js:** Another excellent framework designed specifically for fast-paced browser games. It has built-in client-side prediction and interpolation, which are advanced topics that are crucial for a smooth player experience.

### Recommended Plan of Action

Here is a step-by-step plan for how you could implement multiplayer in "The Stack":

1.  **Set Up the Server:** Create a new Node.js project for your server. I recommend starting with **Colyseus** because it provides a solid structure out of the box.
2.  **Establish Connection:** In your client-side code (likely in `GameManager.ts`), connect to the server. The server will register the new player and assign them a unique ID.
3.  **Synchronize Player Positions:**
    *   **Client:** On every frame, send the local player's input (e.g., `{ left: true, forward: false }`) to the server.
    *   **Server:** Receive the input, update the player's position in the server's authoritative state, and then broadcast the updated positions of *all* players to *all* clients at a regular interval (e.g., 20 times per second).
    *   **Client:** When you receive the game state from the server, update the positions of all other players in your Three.js scene. Your own character should be updated using client-side prediction for a snappy feel.
4.  **Synchronize the Tower:**
    *   **Client:** When a player presses 'E' to pick up a brick or 'B' to place one, send an event to the server (e.g., `server.send('place_brick', { x, y, z })`).
    *   **Server:** Validate the action. Can the player place a brick there? Are they carrying one? If it's a valid move, update the server's representation of the tower.
    *   **Server:** Broadcast the change to all players (e.g., `room.broadcast('new_block', { x, y, z, type })`).
    *   **Client:** When a client receives the `new_block` event, it adds that brick to its local Three.js scene, ensuring everyone sees the same tower.
