# Multiplayer Debugging Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Improved Player Disconnection Handling
- **Problem**: When players closed tabs or refreshed, their visual representations remained in other players' games
- **Solution**: Enhanced the `removeRemotePlayer` method with thorough cleanup of Three.js objects, materials, and animations

### 2. Better Server-Side Disconnect Detection
- **Problem**: Server wasn't sending consistent player identification when players left
- **Solution**: Updated server to send both socket ID and username in disconnect events

### 3. Enhanced Client-Side Cleanup
- **Problem**: Client wasn't properly disposing of Three.js resources when players left
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive cleanup including geometry, materials, and animation mixers

### 4. Page Visibility Handling
- **Problem**: No proper handling of tab switching or page closing
- **Solution**: Added event listeners for page visibility changes and beforeunload events

## New Debug Features

### Keyboard Shortcuts (in game)
- `Shift + M`: Debug multiplayer info
- `Shift + R`: Toggle debug boxes around remote players
- `Shift + X`: Force cleanup all remote players
- `Shift + D`: Show detailed remote player info
- `Shift + S`: Request force sync from server

### Debug Methods (in console)
```javascript
// Show detailed multiplayer status
debugMultiplayer()

// Force cleanup all remote players
forceCleanupPlayers()

// Toggle debug boxes around players
toggleDebugBoxes()

// Show remote player details
window.gameManager.debugRemotePlayersInfo()

// Force cleanup specific player
window.gameManager.multiplayerSystem.removeRemotePlayer('socketId')
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. First Tab Sync Issue Test
1. Open the FIRST tab of your game
2. Copy and paste the contents of `test-first-tab-sync.js` into the console
3. Run `testFirstTabSync()` to see the current state
4. Open 2 more tabs and move the players around
5. In the first tab, run `monitorUpdates()` and watch for 10 seconds
6. If no updates are received, the issue is confirmed
7. Try `Shift + S` to request force sync

### 2. Basic Functionality Test
1. Open 3 tabs of your game (localhost:5174)
2. Verify all players can see each other
3. Move around and verify real-time sync

### 2. Disconnection Test
1. With 3 tabs open, close one tab
2. Check the other tabs - the closed player should disappear within 200ms
3. Check server logs - should show proper disconnect handling

### 3. Refresh Test
1. With multiple tabs open, refresh one tab
2. The refreshed player should reconnect properly
3. Other players should see the reconnection seamlessly

### 4. Debug Tools Test
1. Press `Shift + M` to see multiplayer debug info
2. Press `Shift + R` to see debug boxes around players
3. Press `Shift + X` to force cleanup (should remove all remote players)
4. Press `Shift + D` to see detailed player info

### 5. Network Issues Test
1. Open browser dev tools â†’ Network tab
2. Throttle connection to "Slow 3G"
3. Verify players still sync properly with interpolation

## Debug Files Created

1. **`debug-multiplayer.js`**: Console helper functions
2. **`multiplayer-test.html`**: Visual debug interface
3. **`MULTIPLAYER_DEBUGGING.md`**: This guide

## Server Improvements

The server now:
- Sends both socket ID and username in disconnect events
- Has better reconnection handling
- Provides more detailed logging
- Handles edge cases with socket ID mismatches

## Client Improvements

The client now:
- Properly disposes of Three.js resources
- Has better error handling for missing players
- Includes comprehensive debug tools
- Handles page visibility changes
- Has improved interpolation for smooth movement

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Players not disappearing when tabs close
**Solution**: Use `Shift + X` to force cleanup, then check if the issue persists

### Issue: Multiple instances of same player
**Solution**: Check server logs for socket ID conflicts, use debug tools to identify duplicates

### Issue: Players appearing in wrong positions
**Solution**: Use `Shift + M` to check position data, verify interpolation is working

### Issue: Performance problems with many players
**Solution**: Monitor update frequency with debug tools, adjust update intervals if needed

## Next Steps

1. Test the improved disconnection handling
2. Use the debug tools to identify any remaining issues
3. Monitor server logs for proper cleanup
4. Verify that the visual artifacts (extra name tags) are resolved

The key improvement is that when a player disconnects, the system now:
1. Immediately removes the player from server state
2. Sends a proper disconnect event with both ID and username
3. Thoroughly cleans up all Three.js objects on the client
4. Updates the player count correctly
5. Prevents memory leaks from undisposed resources
