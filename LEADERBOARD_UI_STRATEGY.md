## Database Schema Integration

### Implementation Location
The database schema will be implemented directly into the existing multiplayer architecture:

- **Backend Integration**: Schema integrates with `multiplayer-server` (Node.js/Socket.io)
- **Database Platform**: Fly.io PostgreSQL alongside multiplayer server
- **No Architecture Changes**: Layers on top of current `towerState.json` system
- **Existing Flow Enhancement**: Current brick placement events trigger database updates

### Integration Points

#### Player Management
- **Player Joins**: Create/update player record with existing Farcaster data capture
- **Session Tracking**: Utilize existing connection/disconnection events
- **Real-time Sync**: Leverage current Socket.io infrastructure for live updates

#### Statistics Tracking  
- **Brick Placement**: Hook into existing brick placement events to update `player_stats.bricks_placed`
- **Achievement Checking**: Trigger achievement evaluation on stat updates
- **Daily Activity**: Track building sessions using existing session management
- **Streak Calculation**: Use daily activity patterns for consecutive building days

#### Real-time Updates
- **Leaderboard Changes**: Socket.io broadcasts rank changes to all connected players
- **Achievement Unlocks**: Immediate notifications for milestone achievements
- **Competition Updates**: Live updates when players pass each other in rankings

## UI Design Strategy

### Hybrid Approach: In-Game Panel + Dedicated Page

The optimal user experience combines quick access during gameplay with deep exploration capabilities.

### Primary: In-Game Mini Panel

#### Design Specifications
- **Toggle Button**: Small "üèÜ" icon in top-right corner (similar to chat toggle)
- **Panel Animation**: Slides out from right side of screen
- **Dimensions**: ~300px wide, doesn't obstruct gameplay view
- **Persistence**: Always accessible while building, non-intrusive
- **Performance**: Lightweight, updates without lag

#### Content Hierarchy (Priority Order)
1. **Personal Stats**: "Rank #7 ‚Ä¢ 342 bricks ‚Ä¢ 5-day streak"
2. **Top 5 Players**: Compact list showing names and brick counts
3. **Live Activity Feed**: "Sarah just placed 10 bricks!" real-time updates
4. **Quick Actions**: Share rank button, achievements button, "View Full" button

#### Advantages
- ‚úÖ **No Context Switch**: Players maintain building flow state
- ‚úÖ **Immediate Motivation**: See rank changes without leaving game
- ‚úÖ **Competitive Tension**: Real-time updates create urgency
- ‚úÖ **Habit Formation**: Constant visibility increases engagement

### Secondary: Full Leaderboard Page

#### Page Structure
- **URL Route**: `/leaderboard` (shareable and SEO-friendly)
- **Access Method**: "View Full Leaderboard" button in mini panel
- **Design**: Full-screen immersive experience
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for all device sizes

#### Content Sections
1. **Hero Section**: Large rank card with social sharing capabilities
2. **Tabbed Interface**: All-time, Daily, Weekly, Streaks, Achievements
3. **Player Profiles**: Expandable player details with building history
4. **Social Integration**: Share buttons, challenge friends, achievement gallery

#### Advantages
- ‚úÖ **Deep Exploration**: Complete statistics and historical data
- ‚úÖ **Social Sharing**: Optimized for screenshots and Farcaster casts
- ‚úÖ **Discovery**: Search-friendly for attracting new players
- ‚úÖ **Mobile Experience**: Full-screen optimization for touch devices

- **Performance Testing**: Validate UI behavior with 100+ players and large numbers
- **Social Features**: Test sharing mechanisms with realistic achievement scenarios
- **Edge Case Testing**: Ensure UI handles long usernames, tied rankings, extreme values
